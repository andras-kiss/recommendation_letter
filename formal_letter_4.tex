\opening{Dear Madam,}

This letter is to recommend \emph{Mr. Venkat Rajat Rao Yalamarti} for the \emph{Erasmus Mundus SERP+ master programme}. I first met Rajat in 2019 when he was attending a seminar about the scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) that was presented by an Erasmus+ guest lecturer from the University of La Laguna, Spain. Since one of our research focus is the SECM, soon after the seminar he contacted me if he could learn more about the technique and about electrochemistry in general by doing experiments in our group. He has been showing great interest in the topic and has been participating in the research ever since with a level of dedication and enthusiasm that is well beyond what can be expected from a BSc student. Both his experimental skills and theoretical knowledge surpass the BSc level. These attributes make Rajat an ideal candidate for any research oriented teaching programme.

Rajat finished all of the courses I taught him with excellent grade. (Grade 5, see attached description about the grading system.) He performed the laboratory work with ease and did the evaluation of his results seemingly effortlessly, always reaching the correct conclusion. He is a top 1\% student in our university, and I believe he would be in any other programme.

It is my conviction that Rajat deserves the benefits that the scholarship can provide, and that he would utilize it fully to continue his education and build a successful academic career. \textbf{I fully recommend Rajat for your programme.}

\closing{Sincerely,}
